# Usage
You can either use the bot by inviting it to you discord server using this link: 

http://bot.maratonec.live

Or self-host it using your own computer, by cloning this respository. **Note that by self-hosting the bot, or modifying the bot, you must abide by the bot's license. See LICENSE for more.**
# Commands
To get started you must set an OpenAPI key, which you can find after creating account here: https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys. Then run the command `/setkey` and paste your api key ther.
After that you are done and can use the bot with `/ai`.
One more setting you can change is the maximum number of tokens the bot can use per answer. Default is 500 and recommended range is 200-2000. For that use the command `/settoken`.
